# PyBer_Analysis
  
## Overview of Project
  
### Purpose
  
Per the client's request, the ride-sharing data by city type was reviewed and analyzed to summarize the trends from January 2019 to April 2019. The three city types analyzed were rural, suburban, and urban cities. See below for analyses and recommendations.
  
## Results
  
See the summary table for total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver per the three city types. Urban cities had the highest volume of total rides, drivers, and fares, however had the lowest average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. From a revenue perspective only, the urban cities produced the highest total fares, and therefore may appear to generate the highest profits. Further data review and analysis has to be performed to assess the profits. 

Another interesting observation is the inequity in the average fare per rides and the average fare per drive per city types. Rural cities, for example, cost the most for the rides, and the average fare per driver exceeds the average fare per ride. The lower number of available drivers increased the equity of the average fare per driver. Riders in the rural cities were paying more per ride compared to the riders in urban cities. Urban cities, on the other hand, is the opposite.

First, see the Total fare summary line graph per city type over the period January 2019 to April 2019. Rural cities ranked the lowest for total fare;and the surburban cities ranked second highest, and the urban cities ranked the highest over the period. None of the data series cross over one another. See the multi-line graphs for review as well.

## Summary
  
There are three findings from this analysis. First, the urban cities ranked the highest in total fares over the months of January 2019 to April 2019, and therefore urban cities are recommended for the type of cities to start and  maintain ride-share focus. A second reason to host or focus the ride-share service in urban cities the most is the high availability of possible drivers and therefore, more rides can be provided to the market. After establishing the market in the rural cities, if the company desires to expand to other city types, suburban cities are recommended next from observing the total volume of fares.
